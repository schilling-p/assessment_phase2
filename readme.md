Conways "game of life"
 
SOLUTION IN main[exercise]

The Goal:
 
given an input of 3x3, print out a heatmap showing the adjacent neighbors for each cell
 
   - the input as well as the output are represented with a dictionary
       - each key is a cell
       - the values in the input are either 1 or 0
       - values in the output are the number of neighbors

if heat = 3 -> value = 1
if heat 2 or 3 -> value stays
else -> value = 0
